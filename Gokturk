Göktürk is the alphabet written by the Göktürks (Tukyus) who lived in Mongolia between the years 552-744. Since the documents written in GokTurk remained from the period of the 2nd Gokturk State, GokTurk became the official alphabet of the Khaganate. In short, this period covers the phase that lasted until the end of the period when the Göktürk Khanate ruled. The most striking features of Göktürk are that the sounds /t/ and /k/ at the beginning of the words have not yet been voiced; the /d/ sound in the word is not leaky. In this period, the signs of the original lengths in Turkish are still observable.
